### Why Is this Important?

- _It's hard to give feedback when you're not sure what you're looking at._
- _LARGE PRs can be overwhelming and hard to understand._
- _PRs with multiple purposes are hard to review and can cause issues in the future._

#### Well, what benefits do we get from code reviews?

- Do I get my PR merged faster?

### The Idea

- The goal - improve code quality, share knowledge, and most importantly learn from each other.
